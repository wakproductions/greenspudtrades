EVRY - Had a nice pop in the morning and strong finish with volume on Friday. Watching for a weak open and r/gÂ move.

MAGS - Volume is fading off. Waiting for it to look weak and have a breakdown of support at 5. But still, be careful because this could still squeeze up.

LOCO - looks like it's still strong and could set up for a r/g play and possibly a rip through 37.5

YHOO - things are heating up with the Alibaba (BABA) IPO coming on 9/18. 40's a big magnet number on this one, but I wouldn't be surprised to see YHOO hit ATH's this week.

MBLY - Nice run over the past 2 weeks and breakthrough of the $50 roll.
