I am temporarily shutting down my websites momentumstockscans.com and ustreasuryyieldcurve.com. I initially thought
these websites would generate sufficient traffic to be self-sustainable from ad revenue, but at the moment they
are unprofitable. Both websites require their own databases and run via Docker containers hosted on AWS, which gets
costly. I will put the websites back up as they were once I find a more cost effective hosting solution.
