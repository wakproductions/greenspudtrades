BABA - This thing has been straight up. Looking for it to top out around 100 for it to pull back. May take several days - kind of like GPRO.

CYBR - Nice volatility today. It seems to be breaking out. Looking for a possible ramp back tomorrow.

FB - Expecting this to have some good moves in it coming off of earnings. Unbiased on direction, just play the setups as they come.

EA - Big earnings beat and upped guidance. I was initially thinking this would gap up, but the AH reversal is odd to me. It could still have a strong day tomorrow. If it takes out the ATH of 38.64, sky's the limit.
