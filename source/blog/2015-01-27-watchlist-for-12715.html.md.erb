Quiet watchlist, just as the overall market didn't have a lot of really exciting intraday setups today. Don't try to force things if you don't see a good setup. Tomorrow will be busy for earnings, but mostly big companies are reporting in the premarket that probably won't have a lot of big range off the reports.

MWV - Possible breakaway gap on merger news.

POST - I normally don't like to trade big companies like this, but the chart looks nice. Support of the moving averages and a volume-supported power candle. Would be interested in ABCD / r/g setup.

BIND - Nice triangle shaping up. Will see if 7.30 can hold.

<strong>Possible Movers on Earnings</strong>

COH - Potentially a big mover if it gets above 40 and the earnings are good.
