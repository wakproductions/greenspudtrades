KPTI - Nice chart. Potentially breaking out of its base. At 4:30pm ET they will have a conference call toÂ discuss Phase 1 clinical data for Selinexor (KPT-330) in advanced solid tumors. This may just be a runup into the conference call. I wouldn't hold overnight - buy the anticipation, sell the news. <%= partial 'image', locals: { filename: '2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-29-at-12.22.37-AM.png', caption: ''} %>
