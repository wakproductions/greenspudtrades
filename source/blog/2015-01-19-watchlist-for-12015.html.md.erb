ADXS - Squeezing higher, I think 14-16 is possible. Want to see it retest the previous high of 13.17 and then start grinding up.

DEPO - big power candle, this has a lot of room to run. Interested in buying any ABCD or r/g, and possible hold for swing trade with a risk on the previous resistance, 18.3.

BLUE - Interested in shorting this for a breakdown of the 13EMA, and then let the 13EMA become resistance. It looks like it is coming up to test the previous line of support/resistance. Hopefully it hangs there long enough to get a good entry before dropping. Could go over/under 100.Â Would reconsider the plan if it grinds past 101.

JUNO - This one has a lot of bag holders above now, and seems to be testing that critical area of 51. Watching for that level to act as resistance and for this to retreat back to 45, possibly lower.

HALO - On Friday I tried anticipating a breakdown of the support around the 14 area and quick snap, but it held and grinded up. I think this is acting very bullish and I'm looking closely for a bull flag formation or break through the highs at 15.33.

BABA - Seems to be running a similar course to MBLY. Letting it come back up to test the resistance at 100 and then short for a 92 target.
