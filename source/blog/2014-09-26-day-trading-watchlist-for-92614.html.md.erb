RPRX - News came out after extended hours trading closed for the evening. Positive Phase 2 results. This stock may have a big comeback day tomorrow. Let's see what the price action says.

GPRO - Just when you think this one is done, it squeezes some more. It may have some good washouts to short, but I wouldn't count on any meaningful pullbacks until it crosses below the 13EMA on the daily chart. Until that happens, it may squeeze all the way to 90.

MU - Earnings beat. Crazy AH action. May have some good long moves in it out of the gate.

NKE - Great spike after hours. Could be an all day runner to 90.

IG - Nice daily chart. It looks a lot like TCP from the other day... not that that necessarily means it's going to do the same thing. But could give us either a good r/g setup and run to 10, or a fade off. The stock is up big today on news that it's received the rights to 18 products from AZN.

ACHN - This looks heavy. It's likely to either to break down 10.70 to the next level of support at 10, or breakout the downtrend line.
