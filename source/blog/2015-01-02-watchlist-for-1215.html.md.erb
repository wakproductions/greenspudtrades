Other than NRX and NDRM, I'm not finding many very active stocks of interest for intraday trading on this first trading day of the new year.  Here are 4 setups that I'm looking at for potential swing trades.

ADXS - The breakdown of the 8.25 area of support was textbook! It was almost too good to be true. Looking for 7.90 to crack next in a similar fashion. Should be a smooth ride to 6.75 if it cracks.

EXPE - Looking good for a possible swing if 85 holds over the next several days. If not then 82 is the next level of interest.

GRUB - break of the downtrend. Gets even more interesting thru 37.

FOMX - Continues to act well, flagging to possibly take out the highs at 7.25. I've got a small position... will add if the volume picks up.
