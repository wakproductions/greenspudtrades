CSIQ - Very nice power candle today. Support on MTF at ~25.20. Will be looking for a r/g type setup that allows using it as a risk.

KITE - Looks like its bear flagging intraday. The action reminds me much of 1/16 after it recovered from a big drop and fell at the open the next morning. Short with a risk over/under 64.

ASPX - Same setup as KITE, looking at 58.50 magnet as a guide. Â Looking at seeing this at 55.

SPLS - Potential breakaway gap

NOW - Got supported with dips being quickly bought every morning and that MTF support at 72 is holding. Bull flag/breakaway gap setup. Possible run to 80 if the market permits.
