I didn't like the price action today. Once again the small cap momentum stocks feel very toppish as they did in Q1 going into Q2. I'm less confident in swing trade setups right now. I'm also very concerned about the health of the Russell 2000.

FB - I think there will be a good short play in this very soon.  It's come back to retest the high and failed.

SWIR - Ugly breakdown today. Looking for a pop to 28.30 to short.

TKMR - Another hot stock today. Interested in moves either direction.

EMC - News that they are looking for strategic alternatives came out after hours. This is probably one of the few stocks that can pop out of the gate.

JRJC - Weak close today. It's probably going to fade lower.

ADHD - Nice move up today on clinical trial results. Looking for r/g play.
