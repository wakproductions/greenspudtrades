Here are the things I'm watching this morning.

EYES - gapping up on some new PR, but I think its hitting resistance at 18. Interested in going short using 18.30 stop.

KR - Following a nice earnings beat. Will wait until the open to see if this can turn into a breakaway gap. Will buyÂ any dips down to 72 using 71 area as a stop.

CRM - On the daily chart this has pulled back to the 13EMA and I think can bounce. Looking for ABCD style gearing for long swing trade.

ADSK - Similar setup to CRM. Retest of the breakout area.

CRMD - looks overextended. Interested in going short using yesterday's HOD as a stop area.
