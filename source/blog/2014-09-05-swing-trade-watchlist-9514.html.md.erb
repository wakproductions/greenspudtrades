Here are swing trade setups I'm watching.

KORS - At a support area here around 75. It's gapped down today on news of a secondary offering of 11M shares priced at 76.75  (the whole float is 175M). Based on the strength of today's intraday chart I'm betting this is a short term bottom and the gap gets filled.

CSLT - this trade has worked nicely since my original call to go long thru 11.50. I cashed out of this one and stalking it again for a flag break. The support of the moving averages is a positive.

RATE - This thing has been straight down since mid August. Waiting for the trendline to snap. The intraday action today of a "V" shape followed by some buying volume may indicate that the bottom has been reached.

SFUN - Tapping resistance at 12.70 again. Waiting for it to break.<%= partial 'image', locals: { filename: '2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-1.59.05-PM.png', caption: ''} %>

ATHN - after a nice run up, restesting the moving averages. Will wait for a little consolidation to see if they provide support for it to move higher.

CMCM - looks heavy on the daily chart. If 26 snaps, might make a good day trade short.

JD - pulled right back to the trendline. Good risk/reward area here.

COH - on watch... looks like it wants higher.

WFM - could be good if it gets through 40. But given the concern over fundamentals I think may take several taps or a positive earnings report.

Will be looking at more charts over the weekend. Will post additional ideas as I run across them.
